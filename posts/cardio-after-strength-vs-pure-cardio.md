## Introduction

While aerobic or cardio exercise is popular to improve cardiovascular health, strength training is a great way to build muscle mass, increase strength, and promote bone density. However, it has been controversial whether cardio exercise after strength training provides more health benefits than pure aerobic exercise. In this article, we will compare and analyze the effects of cardio exercise after strength training versus pure aerobic/cardio workouts, the science behind each activity, and their benefits.


## Definition of Cardio Exercise and Strength Training

Cardio exercise includes running, cycling, swimming, and brisk walking. On the other hand, strength training is any physical activity involving resistance or weight training to build muscle strength and size. Examples of strength training exercises include weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance band workouts.

## The Science Behind Cardio Exercise After Strength Training

Many fitness enthusiasts wonder if they should do cardio exercises after strength training or if doing it on a particular day is better. Generally, it's up to your fitness goals and preferences. However, there are some scientific benefits to doing cardio exercises after strength training. When you do strength training, your body depletes its glycogen stores, which are essential for exercise energy. By doing cardio exercise after strength training, you tap into your body's fat stores for energy instead, improving fat loss and weight management. Additionally, cardio exercise after strength training can improve cardiovascular health, reduce muscle soreness and inflammation, and improve endurance and performance during cardio exercise.

## The Science Behind Pure Aerobic/Cardio Exercise

Pure aerobic/cardio exercise includes continuous, rhythmic movements that slowly elevate your heart and breathing rates. This exercise is highly effective for improving cardiovascular health, fat loss and weight management, endurance and performance during cardio exercise, reducing stress, and improving mental health.

## Benefits of Cardio Exercise After Strength Exercise

As mentioned earlier, doing cardio exercise after strength training has numerous benefits, including:
- Improved cardiovascular health
- Enhanced fat loss and weight management
- Reduced muscle soreness and inflammation
- Improved endurance and performance during cardio exercise

## Benefits of Pure Aerobic/Cardio Exercise

Pure aerobic/cardio exercise has many benefits as well, including:
- Improved cardiovascular health
- Enhanced fat loss and weight management
- Improved endurance and performance during cardio exercise


In summary, if you have to choose one activity among them, people who want to build muscle and lose weight simultaneously should do cardio after strength exercises. Pure cardio is for people who only focus on reducing body fat and losing weight.
