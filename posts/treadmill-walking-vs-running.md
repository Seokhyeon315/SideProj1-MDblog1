## Introduction

In today's society, many people seek to burn fat and lose weight through various forms of exercise. The treadmill is one of the popular exercise equipment in the gym. It is known to provide cardiovascular benefits and assist in burning calories. However, many wonder whether running or walking on a treadmill is more effective for burning fat. In this post, we will explore the scientific details behind running and walking on a treadmill to determine which is the best for burning fat.


## What is Treadmill?

The treadmill is a versatile gym equipment that can burn calories and promote weight loss. Usually, in the gym, two groups of people choose running or walking on treadmills. 


## Understanding Fat Burning

It is essential to understand how fat-burning works. Fat is stored in our body as adipose tissue. Precisely, adipose tissue consists of adipocytes. The excess calories are converted into triglycerides and stored in adipocytes. When doing a workout, we consume more calories than our body, which means the body uses stored fat as energy when needed. When the body requires energy, it breaks down stored fat into fatty acids, which are used as fuel for the body.

## Walking on a Treadmill

Walking on a treadmill is a low-impact exercise that is easy on the joints. Walking is also an excellent exercise for beginners or recovering from an injury. When it comes to burning fat, walking on a treadmill can be effective, especially if done for a prolonged period. Walking briskly on a treadmill can help burn calories and promote weight loss. Generally, the average weight person can burn approximately 167 calories by walking at a speed of 3.5 miles per hour for 30 minutes.

## Running on a Treadmill

Running on a treadmill can help burn calories quickly. An average weight person can burn approximately 372 calories by running 5 miles per hour for 30 minutes.


## Should I run or walk on the treadmill?

When burning fat, running and walking on a treadmill can be effective. However, running on a treadmill burns more calories and promotes weight loss faster than walking. Running burns approximately twice as many calories as walking. However, it is essential to note that running is a high-impact exercise that may only suit some. Walking on a treadmill is a low-impact exercise that is easier on the joints and may be a better option for those with injuries or joint problems.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, running and walking on a treadmill can effectively burn fat and promote weight loss. Even though running on a treadmill burns more calories and promotes weight loss faster than walking, walking on a treadmill is better if you are a beginner or have an injury. Choosing an exercise suitable for your fitness level and physical condition is essential.
